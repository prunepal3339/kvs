## KVS - Key Value Server

An attempt to clone redis server from scratch in Go while keeping it minimal.

### HOW TO USE?
1. Use this [docs](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/cli/) to install and learn more about redis cli.
2. Run the server using `go run main.go`.

**NOTE**: You need to stop redis server if it is already running as our program uses the same port as redis server.
